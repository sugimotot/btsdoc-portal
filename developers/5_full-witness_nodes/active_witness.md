## A Block-Producing Witness

### Requirements
- A registered account in the corresponding network (see i.e. Accounts)
- Some funds in the account to pay for the registration fee
- Executable binary

**Hardware Advice:** Dedicated servers with minimum 16 GB (32 GB advised) Ram, SSD disks advised.

### Active Witness Duties

- Be a reliable blockproducer
- Maintain a public seednode
- Publish accurate, frequently updated (check 1-2 times per hour), price feeds for the Smart Coins & Market Pegged Assets

## How to become a Block-Producing Witness

### 1. Run the Witness/Full Node on the network
We first run the witness node without block production and connect it to the P2P network with the following command: 

    $ programs/witness_node/witness_node --rpc-endpoint 127.0.0.1:8090

This command opens a RPC port for local host so that we can later connect the CLI wallet with it. After the network was synced and periodically receives new blocks from other participants, we can go on to the next step.

### 2. Launch a wallet
We now open up the cli_wallet (i.g. create a wallet). The following command connects to our plain Witness (Fill) node:

    $ programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet -s ws://127.0.0.1:8090

After launched the wallet successfully, first thing to do is setting up a password for the newly created wallet prior to importing any private keys:

**set_password**

    new >>> set_password <password>
    set_password <password>
    null
    locked >>>

**unlock**

    locked >>> unlock "<password>"
    unlock "<password>"
    null
    unlocked >>>

Wallet creation is now done.

### 3. Gain Access to Blockchain
We import the account name (owner key) and the balance containing (active key) into the CLI wallet:

**import_key** (owner wifkey), **import_key** (active wifkey), **list_my_accounts** , **list_account_balances**

    >>> import_key <accountname> <owner wif key>
    true
    >>> import_key <accountname> <active wif key>
    true
    >>> list_my_accounts
    [{
        "id": "1.2.15",
        ...
        "name": <accountname>,
        ...
    ]
    >>> list_account_balances <accountname>
    XXXXXXX BTS

Both keys can be exported from the web wallet.

**upgrade_account**

Since only lifetime members can become witnesses, you must first upgrade to a lifetime member. This step costs the lifetime-upgrade fee:

    >>> upgrade_account <accountname> true
    [a transaction in json format]

### 4. Registering a new Witness Object
To become a witness and be able to produce blocks, you first need to create a witness object that can be voted in.

**create_witness**

    >>> create_witness <accountname> "http://<url-to-proposal>" true
    {
      "ref_block_num": 139,
      "ref_block_prefix": 3692461913,
      "relative_expiration": 3,
      "operations": [[
      21,{
        "fee": {
          "amount": 0,
          "asset_id": "1.3.0"
        },
        "witness_account": "1.2.16",
        "url": "url-to-proposal",
        "block_signing_key": "<PUBLIC KEY>",
        "initial_secret": "00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
      }
    ]
      ],
      "signatures": [
          "1f2ad5597af2ac4bf7a50f1eef2db49c9c0f7616718776624c2c09a2dd72a0c53a26e8c2bc928f783624c4632924330fc03f08345c8f40b9790efa2e4157184a37"
      ]
    }

Our witness is registered, but it canâ€™t produce blocks because nobody has voted it in. You can see the current list of active witnesses by the following command:

**get_global_properties**

    >>> get_global_properties
    {
      "active_witnesses": [
    "1.6.0",
    "1.6.1",
    "1.6.2",
    "1.6.3",
    "1.6.4",
    "1.6.5",
    "1.6.7",
    "1.6.8",
    "1.6.9"
      ],
      ...

Now, we should vote our witness in. Vote all of the shares your account `<accountname>` in favor of your new witness.

**vote_for_witness**

    >>> vote_for_witness <accountname> <accountname> true true
    [a transaction in json format]

> Note: If you want to experiment with things that require voting, be aware that votes are only tallied once per day at the maintenance interval. `get_dynamic_global_properties` tells us when that will be in `next_maintenance_time`. Once the next maintenance interval passes, run `get_global_properties` again and you should see that your new witness has been voted in.

We need to wait until the next maintenance interval until we can see votes casted for our witness.
