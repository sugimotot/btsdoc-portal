## Monitoring Account Deposits - Python

### Installation

A graphene Python 3.0 library can be installed by issuing

    git clone http://github.com/xeroc/python-graphenelib
    cd python-graphenelib
    easy_install-3.4 install autobahn
    python3 setup.py install --user

As you can see, this library requires Python3 and will **not** work properly with Python2.

### Configuration

To make use of this library, we can instruct any full-node to send notifications for all incoming transactions for any account. Letâ€™s discuss the following example script in more details:

We first prepare our variables and import all required modules

Define the accountID and the memo_wif_key in examples/monitor.py. The accountID can be obtained from the GUI wallet, or by issuing::

    >>> get_account <accountname>

If the script exists abnormally, you can continue operations by setting last_op to the last operation id that you have captured before the abnormal exit.

> Note : The current implementation has a maxium history size of 100 transaction. If you have missed more than 100 transaction with the current implementation, manual fixing is required.

Furthermore, in Graphene, memos are usually encrypted using a distinct memo key. That way, exposing the memo private key will only expose transaction memos (for that key) and not compromise any funds. It is thus safe to store the memo private key in 3rd party services and scripts. The memo public key can be obtained from the account settings or via command line::

    >>> get_account <myaccount>

in the cli wallet. The corresponding private key can be obtain from::

    >>> dump_private_keys


Note that the latter command exposes all private keys in clear-text wif.

### Running

The monitoring script can be executed via

    python3 monitor.py
