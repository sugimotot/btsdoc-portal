## 1. Installation_Configuration of Witness 

### 1.1 Fork the BitShares-Core code base 

    git clone https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core.git bitshares-core-testnet
    cd bitshares-core-testnet/
    git checkout testnet

### 1.2 Configuration


**Blockchain Parameters**

The blockchain parameters can be modified in the
[libraries/chain/include/graphene/chain/config.hpp](https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene/blob/master/libraries/chain/include/graphene/chain/config.hpp) file:

    vim libraries/chain/include/graphene/chain/config.hpp

**Default Seed Node List**

We can add a default list of seed nodes that the witness is supposed to try to connect to in ][libraries/app/application.cpp](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/blob/master/libraries/app/application.cpp) and will add the IP/Address and port of the machine we are going to setup later already:

    testnet.bitshares.eu:11010

The full changeset can be seen in the corresponding [git commit](https://github.com/BitSharesEurope/graphene-testnet/commit/94f0a95be6f80cb5a7926ba6cc920dd795eb3a19)

### 1.3 Initial Compilation

    cmake .
    make

We first need to compile the graphene toolkit so that we can let it
generate a plain genesis file in the proper format.



## 2. Genesis Configuration

### 2.1 Create a Genesis file

We will create a genesis file named ``my-genesis.json`` that contains the genesis block:

    mkdir -p genesis
    programs/witness_node/witness_node --create-genesis-json genesis/my-genesis.json
    vim genesis/my-genesis.json

The ``my-genesis.json`` is the initial state of the network.

### 2.2 Edit a Genesis file

If you want to customize the network's initial state, edit ``my-genesis.json``.
This allows you to control things such as:

- The accounts that exist at genesis, their names and public keys
- Assets and their initial distribution (including core asset)
- The initial values of chain parameters
- The account / signing keys of the ``init`` witnesses (or in fact any account at all).

The chain ID is a hash of the genesis state.  All transaction signatures
are only valid for a single chain ID.  So editing the genesis file will
change your chain ID, and make you unable to sync with all existing
chains (unless one of them has exactly the same genesis file you do).

**Copy final Genesis**

We now copy our gensis template file over to the graphene root directory::

    $ cp genesis/my-genesis.json genesis.json
    $ vim genesis.json
    $ git add genesis.json
    $ git commit -m "Added genesis.json"

The **initial timestamp** needs to be pasted into ``genesis.json`` file in the `initial_timestamp` field. Choose it relatively close to the future where you can generate the genesis block (e.g. now plus 10 minutes).

**Include Genesis into the binaries**

To let the binaries know about your new genesis block, we need to recompile it and provide ``cmake`` with the parameter to identify the genesis block properly:

    $ make clean
    $ find . -name "CMakeCache.txt" | xargs rm -f
    $ find . -name "CMakeFiles" | xargs rm -Rf
    $ cmake -DGRAPHENE_EGENESIS_JSON="$(pwd)/genesis.json" .

You can add the ``GRAPHENE_EGENESIS_JSON`` to the default parameters by
adding:

    set(GRAPHENE_EGENESIS_JSON "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/genesis.json" )

to the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file. This way, you don't need to provide this
parameter all the time.




## 3. Initializing Blockchain

### 3.1 Initialize the Genesis Block

The ``--enable-stale-production`` flag tells the ``witness_node`` to produce on a chain with zero blocks or very old blocks.  We specify the ``--enable-stale-production`` parameter on the command line as we will
not normally need it (although it can also be specified in the config file).

    programs/witness_node/witness_node --genesis-json genesis.json \
                                      --enable-stale-production \
                                      --data-dir data/testnet

**Chain ID:**

    Started witness node on a chain with 0 blocks.
    Chain ID is cf307110d029cb882d126bf0488dc4864772f68d9888d86b458d16e6c36aa74b

> Note: If other witness produces blocks and witness participation is high enough, subsequent runs which connect to an existing witness node over the p2p network, or which get blockchain state from an existing data directory, need not have the ``--enable-stale-production`` flag.

### 3.2 Set up Block Production

Create a very basic configuration file in `data/testnet/config.ini`:
    
    $ mkdir -p data/testnet
    $ vim data/testnet/config.ini

All we put into the configuration file is the ids and the keys for the witnesses so that we can start producing blocks 

    witness-id = "1.6.1"
    witness-id = "1.6.2"
    witness-id = "1.6.3"
    witness-id = "1.6.4"
    witness-id = "1.6.5"
    witness-id = "1.6.6"
    witness-id = "1.6.7"
    witness-id = "1.6.8"
    witness-id = "1.6.9"
    witness-id = "1.6.10"
    # For each witness, add pubkey and private key:
    private-key = ["GPH6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV","5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3"]
    private-key = [<pubkey>,<privkey>]
    private-key = [<pubkey>,<privkey>]
    private-key = [<pubkey>,<privkey>]
    private-key = [<pubkey>,<privkey>]
    private-key = [<pubkey>,<privkey>]
    private-key = [<pubkey>,<privkey>]
    private-key = [<pubkey>,<privkey>]
    private-key = [<pubkey>,<privkey>]
    private-key = [<pubkey>,<privkey>]
    private-key = [<pubkey>,<privkey>]

This authorizes the ``witness_node`` to produce blocks on behalf of the listed ``witness-id``'s, and specifies the private key needed to sign those blocks.  Normally each witness would be on a different node, but for the purposes of this testnet, we will start out with all witnesses signing blocks on a single node.

> Note: The setting ``rpc-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:11011`` will open up the RPC-port `11011` to connect a cli-wallet or web wallet to it. With the ``p2p-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:11010`` being accessible from the internet, this node can be used as seed node.

### 3.3 Embedding the Genesis block (optional)

Now that we have the blockchain established and the used correct genesis block, we can have it embedded into the binaries directly. For that reasons we have moved it into the root directory and called it ``genesis.json`` for the default compile toolchain to catch it automatically. We recompile to include the genesis block with:

    make clean
    find . -name "CMakeCache.txt" | xargs rm -f
    find . -name "CMakeFiles" | xargs rm -Rf
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .

Deleting caches will reset all ``cmake`` variables, you might be asked to set other ``cmake`` variables. You will have to add those variables to the ``cmake`` line above.

Embedding the genesis copies the entire content of genesis block into the ``witness_node`` binary, and additionally copies the chain ID into the ``cli_wallet`` binary.  Embedded genesis allows the following simplifications to the subsequent instructions:

* You need **not** specify the genesis file on the witness node command line, or in the witness node configuration file.
* You need **not** specify the chain ID on the ``cli_wallet`` command line when starting a new wallet.


## 4. Connecting a CLI wallet

We will show how to connect a cli-wallet to the new blockchain and generate our first transaction on the new blockchain.

In order to create a wallet, you must specify the previously setup server. With the witness node’s default access control settings.

**Create a Wallet - Public Testnet**

    programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet --wallet-file my-wallet.json -s ws://127.0.0.1:11011 -H 127.0.0.1:8090 -r 127.0.0.1:8099

> Note: The parameter `-H` is required so that we can interface with the cli-wallet via RPC-HTTP-JSON, later while -r will open a port for the Ruby-based faucet.

If you get the `set_password` prompt, it means your CLI has successfully conected to the testnet witness node.

**Set a password**

This password is used to encrypt the private keys in the wallet. (e.g., `supersecret` is a password)

    >>> set_password supersecret

**unlock the wallet**

    >>> unlock supersecret


### Gain Access to Stake

In Graphene, balances are contained in accounts. To import an account that exists in the Graphene genesis. (i.g.,\<name\> is an account name owning the key.  \<wifkey\> is a private key)

**import_key**

    >>> import_key <name> "<wifkey>"

Funds are stored in genesis balance objects. These funds can be claimed, with no fee.

**import_balance**

    >>> import_balance <name> ["*"] true

### Manage Accounts

**Obtain Lifetime member (LTM) status**

Requires lifetime member (LTM) status to create an account. You can upgrade the account.

    >>> upgrade_account faucet true

**Register Account**

    register_account <name> <owner-public_key> <active-public_key> <registrar_account> <referrer_account> <referrer_percent> <broadcast>

This command allows you to register an account using only a **public key**. 

**example**

    >>> register_account alpha GPH4zSJHx7D84T1j6HQ7keXWdtabBBWJxvfJw72XmEyqmgdoo1njF GPH4zSJHx7D84T1j6HQ7keXWdtabBBWJxvfJw72XmEyqmgdoo1njF faucet faucet 0 true

**transfer**

Test `transfer` to send `CORE` from `faucet` to `alpha` user.

    >>> transfer faucet alpha 100000 CORE "here is the cash" true

**Open a new Wallet for `alpha` user**

    >>> import_key alpha 5HuCDiMeESd86xrRvTbexLjkVg2BEoKrb7BAA5RLgXizkgV3shs

    >>> upgrade_account alpha true

    >>> create_witness alpha "http://www.alpha" true

**Obtain the private key**

The `get_private_key` command allows us to obtain the **private key** corresponding to the block signing key.

    >>> get_private_key GPH6viEhYCQr8xKP3Vj8wfHh6WfZeJK7H9uhLPDYWLGCRSj5kHQZM


## 5. Establish a Committee

Our network, of course, needs a committee. We need to initially create new accounts and let them apply as committee member.

### 5.1 Creating members

    create_account_with_brain_key com0 com0 faucet faucet true
    create_account_with_brain_key com1 com1 faucet faucet true
    create_account_with_brain_key com2 com2 faucet faucet true
    create_account_with_brain_key com3 com3 faucet faucet true
    create_account_with_brain_key com4 com4 faucet faucet true
    create_account_with_brain_key com5 com5 faucet faucet true
    create_account_with_brain_key com6 com6 faucet faucet true

### 5.2 Upgrading members

Since only lifetime members can be committee members, we need to fund these accounts and upgrade them accordingly:

    transfer faucet com0 100000 CORE "some cash" true
    transfer faucet com1 100000 CORE "some cash" true
    transfer faucet com2 100000 CORE "some cash" true
    transfer faucet com3 100000 CORE "some cash" true
    transfer faucet com4 100000 CORE "some cash" true
    transfer faucet com5 100000 CORE "some cash" true
    transfer faucet com6 100000 CORE "some cash" true
    upgrade_account com0 true
    upgrade_account com1 true
    upgrade_account com2 true
    upgrade_account com3 true
    upgrade_account com4 true
    upgrade_account com5 true
    upgrade_account com6 true

### 5.3 Registering as committee member

We can apply for committee with create_committee_member:

    create_committee_member com0 "" true
    create_committee_member com1 "" true
    create_committee_member com2 "" true
    create_committee_member com3 "" true
    create_committee_member com4 "" true
    create_committee_member com5 "" true
    create_committee_member com6 "" true


### 5.4 Voting with faucet account

All we need to do know is vote for our own committee members:

    vote_for_committee_member faucet com0 true true
    vote_for_committee_member faucet com1 true true
    vote_for_committee_member faucet com2 true true
    vote_for_committee_member faucet com3 true true
    vote_for_committee_member faucet com4 true true
    vote_for_committee_member faucet com5 true true
    vote_for_committee_member faucet com6 true true

## 6. Web Wallet

Since we need to provide a way for people to enter the network/blockchain, we need to install the web wallet into nginx.

### 6.1 Installation of Dependencies

    sudo apt-get install git nodejs-legacy npm
    sudo npm install -g webpack coffee-script

### 6.2 Fetching the web wallet

Afterwards, we download the graphene-ui repository from Cryptonomex and install the Node dependencies

    git clone https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene-ui
    cd graphene-ui/

    for I in dl web; do cd $I; npm install; cd ..; done

### 6.3 Configuration

Obtain the chain_id of the chain we are running.

    $ curl --data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "get_chain_properties", "params": [], "id": 1}' http://127.0.0.1:11011/rpc && echo

The chain id is used to let the web wallet know to which network it connects and how to deal with it. For this we modify the file dl/src/chain/config.coffee and add our blockchain::

    Test:
    core_asset: "TEST"
    address_prefix: "TEST"
    chain_id: "<chain-id>"

Furthermore, we need to tell our web wallet to which witness node to connect to. This can be done in the file dl/src/stores/SettingsStore.js.

    connection: "ws://<host>/ws",
    faucet_address: "https://<host>",

    # also edit the "default" settings

### 6.4 Compilation

**Compile the web wallet**  - This will generate the static files in the dist/ folder.

    cd web
    npm run build

## 7. Set up the Faucet

In order to allow people that do not have funds yet to enter the system, we need to setup a faucet. Here, we will also use mina as our **deployment tool** for a productive installation.

### 7.1 Installation of Dependencies

Install every other dependency that is needed and not yet installed

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev
    # put a master password for mysql

Also install a decently recent version of Ruby

    cd
    git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git .rbenv
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
    exec $SHELL

    git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    exec $SHELL

    git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv-gem-rehash.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/rbenv-gem-rehash

    sudo rbenv install 2.2.3
    sudo rbenv global 2.2.3
    sudo gem install bundle

### 7.2 Get the Source 

    git clone https://github.com/cryptonomex/faucet
    cd faucet
    sudo bundle   # ignore warnings


### 7.3 Configuration

 - 1 ) the faucet itself,
 - 2 ) rails API secrets,
 - 3 ) database access,
 - 4 ) and the deployment tool, mina.

**1) Faucet**

All required settings are in config/faucet.yml which has an example file:

    cp config/faucet-example.yml config/faucet.yml
    vim config/faucet.yml

**2) Rails API**

Rails needs to know a secret for their internals, we can get a new one with rake secret. Put it into the corresponding lines in the config file.

    cp config/secrets-example.yml config/secrets.yml
    rake secret
    vim config/secrets.yml

**3a) Database Access**

The default configuration for the database access expects an empty root password for MySQL. Hence, if you have set a different password, you need to provide it here.

    vim config/database.yml

We generate our databases with:

    rake db:create; rake db:migrate; rake db:seed
    RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load

**3b) Database Settings**

We also need to add an entry to the database so that page loads and referrals work properly:

   1. Go to `/www/current`
   2. execute: `rails db`, a mysql console will open
   3.  Execute: `insert into widgets set allowed_domains='testnet.bitshares.eu'`; (replace the domain with your domain)


**4) Mina deployment**

Mina is used to deploy the faucet properly and move all the required files over to the production machine (may be the same machine).

    cp config/deploy-example.yml config/deploy.yml
    vim config/deploy.yml

Make sure to add your ssh-pub key to your authorized file so that mina can deploy to the corrseponding machine.

Create the public directly that is served and copy/link the configuration file to the deployment’s shared files.

    sudo mkdir /www
    sudo chown -R gph:gph /www

    mina setup
    ln -s $HOME/faucet/config/faucet.yml /www/shared/config/
    ln -s $HOME/faucet/config/secrets.yml /www/shared/config/
    ln -s $HOME/faucet/config/database.yml /www/shared/config/

Deploy mina and the wallet with:

    ln -s $HOME/graphene-ui/web/dist $HOME/faucet/public/wallet
    mina deploy
    mina wallet

### Update Wallet

If you have modified something in the wallet, you need to recompile the Javascript/HTML files and re-deploy the wallet with:

    _# re-compile_
    cd ~/graphene-ui/web
    git pull # fetch changes from origin
    npm run build

    _ # deploy_
    cd ~/faucet
    mina wallet

## 8. Nignx Webserver

We here use Nginx to deal with Ruby and provide access to the wallet files and the faucet. We use passenger to do so which unfortunatelly requires to compile nginx “manually”. Passenger fortunatelly provides a script that handles all the installation.

### 8.1 Setup

    sudo apt-get install curl libcurl4-gnutls-dev
    cd ~/faucet
    gem install passenger
    sudo passenger-install-nginx-module

After using the recommended settings and waiting for the script to complete, we integrate nginx into our distribution via

    sudo ln -s /opt/nginx/ /usr/local/nginx
    sudo ln -s /opt/nginx/conf/ /etc/nginx

### 8.2 Configuration

Nginx is configured using the freshly installed nginx.conf file:

    vi /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf

We have set it to be:

    user gph;
    worker_processes  4;
    
    events {
        worker_connections  1024;
    }
    
    http {
        passenger_root /home/gph/.rbenv/versions/2.2.3/lib/ruby/gems/2.2.0/gems/passenger-5.0.23;
        passenger_ruby /home/gph/.rbenv/versions/2.2.3/bin/ruby;
        passenger_max_request_queue_size 1000;
    
        include       mime.types;
        default_type  application/octet-stream;
    
        access_log  /www/logs/access.log;
        error_log  /www/logs/error.log;
        log_not_found off;
    
        sendfile        on;
        #tcp_nopush     on;
    
        keepalive_timeout  65;
    
        gzip  on;
    
        upstream websockets {
          ## Put the witness node's websocket rpc port here:
          server localhost:11011;
        }
    
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name localhost;
    
            location ~ ^/[\w\d\.-]+\.(js|css|dat|png|json)$ {
                root /www/current/public/;
                try_files $uri /wallet$uri =404;
            }

            location ~ /ws/? {
                access_log off;
                proxy_pass http://websockets;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            }  
            location / {
                passenger_enabled on;
                root /www/current/public/;
            }
        }
    }

 > Note: The parameters passenger_root and passenger_ruby may be different in your setup. Please compare with the default nginx.conf file to identify the proper directories.

We create an _upstream _called `websockets` which is uses to proxy the queries to `http://host/ws` directly to the websocket server. This allows to have a websocket address be available from the same port as the web wallet.

### 8.3 Running nginx as serice

We use a nginx serice script and can install it according to:

    sudo wget https://raw.github.com/JasonGiedymin/nginx-init-ubuntu/master/nginx -O /etc/init.d/nginx
    sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/nginx
    sudo update-rc.d -f nginx defaults

After that, nginx can be launched with

    sudo service nginx start

> Note: To reload nginx.  `sudo service nginx reload` 

## 9. Instillation of Python Library

### 9.1 Requirements

Install pip3 which will deal with the packages dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip

### 9.2 Installation

Afterwards, we can fetch the python libraries from github and install it: .. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/xeroc/python-graphenelib cd python-graphenelib/

    pip3 install –user -r requirements.txt python3 setup.py install –user

### Usage

The usage of this library is well documented on

* https://readthedocs.org/projects/python-graphenelib/

## 10. Create MPAs/UIAs

We now create some Market Pegged assets and construct the price feed.

* Create Market Pegged Assets: 
   - https://github.com/BitSharesEurope/testnet-pythonscripts/blob/master/create_mpa.py
* Fund init* witnessses: 
   - https://github.com/BitSharesEurope/testnet-pythonscripts/blob/master/fund-inits.py
* Price feed scripts:
   - https://github.com/BitSharesEurope/testnet-pythonscripts/blob/master/feed.last.py
   - https://github.com/BitSharesEurope/testnet-pythonscripts/blob/master/feed.parity.py
   - https://github.com/BitSharesEurope/testnet-pythonscripts/blob/master/feed.random.py

We can use cron to runt he price feed script on a regular basis:

    */15 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/gph/testnet-pythonscripts/feed.last.py
    */15 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/gph/testnet-pythonscripts/feed.random.py
    0    * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/gph/testnet-pythonscripts/feed.parity.py
