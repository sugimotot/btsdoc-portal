## Wallet Privacy  Protocol
#### How maintain user and merchant privacy from the wallet provider which should never have direct access to the invoice data.

***

In this example, we assume 

- `https://merchant.org`  is the service that host the server,
- `https://wallet.org`  is the wallet provider that host the server

## Privacy Concerns
     
The goal of this protocol is to maintain user and merchant privacy from the wallet provider which should never have direct access to the invoice data.

To securely pass data from `https://merchant.org` to the javascript wallet hosted at `https://wallet.org`, the data will have to be passed after the `#`. 
Assuming the wallet provider is not serving up pages designed to compromise your privacy, only your web browser will have access to the invoice data.


## Preparation

### Step 1 - Define your Invoice via JSON Object

This invoice provides all of the data needed by the wallet to display an invoice to the user.

    {
       "to" : "merchant_account_name",
       "to_label" : "Merchant Name",
       "memo" : "Invoice #1234",
       "currency": "BTS",
       "line_items" : [
            { "label" : "Something to Buy", "quantity": 1, "price" : "1000.00 SYMBOL" },
            { "label" : "10 things to Buy", "quantity": 10, "price" : "1000.00 SYMBOL" },
            { "label" : "User Specified Price", "quantity": 1, "price" : "CUSTOM SYMBOL" },
            { "label" : "User Asset and Price", "quantity": 1, "price" : "CUSTOM" }
        ],
        "note" : "Something the merchant wants to say to the user",
        "callback" : "https://merchant.org/complete"
    }

By itself this data is 579 characters which after URL encoding is 916 characters, with a 2000 character limit this approach doesnâ€™t scale as well as we would like.

### Step 2 - Compress the JSON Object

Using [LZMA-JS](https://github.com/nmrugg/LZMA-JS/) library to compress the JSON into a binary array. This will be the most compact form of the data. 

(e.g.) After running the compression the example JSON was reduced to 281 bytes from 579 bytes.

### Step 3 - Convert to Base58

Using the [bs58](http://cryptocoinjs.com/modules/misc/bs58/) library encode the compressed data in base58. Base58 is URL friendly and size efficient. 

(e.g.) After converting to base58 the string will be 385 characters which can easily be passed in a URL and easily support much larger invoices.

## Pass an Invoice

### Step 4: Pass to Wallet

Once the Base58 data is known, it can be passed to the wallet with the following URL::

    https://wallet.org/#/invoice/BASE58BLOB

### Step 5: Receive Callback from Wallet

After the wallet has signed a transaction, broadcast it, and gotten confirmation from `https://wallet.org` that the transaction was included in `block 12345` as `transaction 4` wallet will direct the user to `https://merchant.org/complete?block=12345&trx=4`.

The merchant will then request that transaction from `https://wallet.org/api?block=12345&trx=4` which will respond with the transaction that was included in the blockchain. The merchant will decrypt the memo from the transaction and use memo content to confirm payment for the invoice.

### Step 6: Payment Complete

At this point the user has successfully made a payment and the merchant has verified the payment has been received without having to maintain a full node.

### Example: Python script

    import json
    import lzma
    from graphenebase.base58 import base58encode, base58decode
    from binascii import hexlify, unhexlify

    invoice = {
        "to": "bitshareseurope",
        "to_label": "BitShares Europre",
        "currency": "EUR",
        "memo": "Invoice #1234",
        "line_items": [
            {"label": "Something to Buy", "quantity": 1, "price": "10.00"},
            {"label": "10 things to Buy", "quantity": 10, "price": "1.00"}
        ],
        "note": "Payment for reading awesome documentation",
        "callback": "https://bitshares.eu/complete"
    }

    compressed = lzma.compress(bytes(json.dumps(invoice), 'utf-8'), format=lzma.FORMAT_ALONE)
    b58 = base58encode(hexlify(compressed).decode('utf-8'))
    url = "https://bitshares.openledger.info/#/invoice/%s" % b58

    print(url)
