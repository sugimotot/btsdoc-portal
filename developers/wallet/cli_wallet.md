### Overview:

The Cli_wallet creates a local _wallet.json_ file that contains the encrypted private keys. The key is required to access the funds and add new data to the blockchain. You will need to `unlock` the wallet before you start interacting with the blockchain. It requires a running witness node (API server) to interface with the blockchain.

**Reminder**: To register an account, the registrar needs to be a lifetime member. You can upgrade the account to *Lifetime member (LTM) status.* (e.g. `faucet` is the registrar in an example below)

    >>> upgrade_account faucet true

## Cli-Tools for Windows (option)

You might have an option to use `cli tools` for Windows to start a cli-wallet. You do not need to install BitShates Core project. If you are interested, check a BitShares release page ( https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/releases) and download the BitShares-Core-*-x64-cli-tools.zip. Here is an instruction [link.](/developers/1_installation/1-4_windows_cli_tools.md#contents)

## Create a Cli Wallet and Open RPC port

We assume you have...
   - Successfully installed BitShares Core
   - Successfully build ($make)

And  compile the cli wallet manually via, 

     $ make cli_wallet 

### Requirements 

It requires a running witness node (not necessarily locally) and connects to it.

Your running witness/full node might be _BitShares Public Full Nodes_, or run by _businesses_ or _individuals_.

### After opened the port

You will be prompted: `locked >>>`. You need to unlock the wallet. After the `unlock`, you can issue any command available to the cli-wallet (Wallet APIs) or construct your own transaction manually. For the trading, the wallet needs to be unlocked sign trading orders. 

----

## Case 1: Connecting a Cli-Wallet

We use the public API node of OpenLedger `wss://bitshares.openledger.info/ws` and connect via secured websocket connection:

**Create a Wallet**

    ./programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet -s wss://bitshares.openledger.info/ws

This will **open the cli-wallet** and unless you already have a local wallet, and will ask you to provide a password for your local wallet. Once a wallet has been created (default wallet file is *wallet.json*), you will receive,

    new >>>

**set_password**

(e.g.) we used `supersecretpassphrase` as a password.

    new >>> set_password supersecretpassphrase
    set_password supersecretpassphrase
    null
    locked >>>

The wallet can be unlocked by providing the password.

**unlock**

    locked >>> unlock "supersecretpassphrase"
    
    unlocked >>>

> Note: After this point, you can issue any command available to the cli-wallet (Wallet APIs) or construct your own transaction manually.

### Opening Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Port

In order to allow RPC calls for wallet operations (spend, buy, sell, …) you can choose between pure RPC or RPC-HTTP requests.

* websocket RPC via the `-r` parameter, and
* HTTP RPC via the `-H` parameter:

In our example below, it shows that the cli-wallet opens two RPC ports. You can interface your application with it.

    ./programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet -s wss://bitshares.openledger.info/ws -H 127.0.0.1:8092 -r 127.0.0.1:8093

The command above will open the cli-wallet and, unless you already have a local wallet, will ask you to provide a password for your local wallet. Once a wallet has been created (default wallet file is `wallet.json`), it will prompt with `locked >>>`.

***

## Case 2: Connecting a Cli-Wallet


**Create a Wallet**

    /programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet -s ws://127.0.0.1:8090

Depending on the actual chain that you want to connect to your may need to specify –chain-id.

### Opening Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) Port

In order to allow RPC calls for wallet operations (spend, buy, sell, …) you can choose between pure RPC or RPC-HTTP requests. In this example, the latter is preferred since well established libraries make use of the RPC-HTTP protocol.

The cli-wallet can open a RPC port so that you can interface your application with it. 

**To enable RPC-HTTP in your wallet you need to run:**

    # recommended for use with python, or curl:
    /programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet --rpc-http-endpoint="127.0.0.1:8092"
    # or
    /programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet --rpc-endpoint="127.0.0.1:8092"

depending on the kind of RPC protocol.

* websocket RPC via the `-r` parameter
* HTTP RPC via the `-H` parameter


**This example will open the port 8092 for local queries only. It is not recommended to publicly expose your wallet!**

***

## Case 3: Connecting a Cli-Wallet in Public Testnet

We will now show how to connect a cli-wallet to the new blockchain and generate our first transaction on the new blockchain.

In order to create a wallet (on Public Testnet), you must specify the previously setup server. With the witness node’s default access control settings.


**Create a Wallet - Public Testnet**

    programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet --wallet-file my-wallet.json -s ws://127.0.0.1:11011 -H 127.0.0.1:8090 -r 127.0.0.1:8099

> Note: The parameter `-H` is required so that we can interface with the cli-wallet via RPC-HTTP-JSON, later while -r will open a port for the Ruby-based faucet.

If you get the `set_password` prompt, it means your CLI has successfully conected to the testnet witness node.

> To use the wallet, you must `unlock` the wallet.

## Gaining Access to Blockchain

In Graphene, balances are contained in accounts. To import an account that exists in the Graphene genesis. (i.g.,\<name\> is an account name owning the key.  \<wifkey\> is a private key)

### Import

**import_key**

    >>> import_key <name> "<wifkey>"

Funds are stored in genesis balance objects. These funds can be claimed, with no fee.

**import_balance**

    >>> import_balance <name> ["*"] true

### Register
To register an account, the registrar needs to be a lifetime member. You can upgrade the account to *Lifetime member (LTM) status.* (e.g. `faucet` is the registrar in an example below)

    >>> upgrade_account faucet true

**register Account**

    >>> register_account <name> <owner-public_key> <active-public_key> <registrar_account> <referrer_account> <referrer_percent> <broadcast>

This command allows you to register an account using only a **public key**. 

*Example*

    >>> register_account alpha GPH4zSJHx7D84T1j6HQ7keXWdtabBBWJxvfJw72XmEyqmgdoo1njF GPH4zSJHx7D84T1j6HQ7keXWdtabBBWJxvfJw72XmEyqmgdoo1njF faucet faucet 0 true

### Transferring Funds using the Cli-wallet

In `transfer`, if the broadcast flag is `False`, the wallet will construct and sign, but **not** broadcast the transaction. This can be very useful for a cold storage setup or to verify transactions.

**transfer**

    unlocked >> transfer <from> <to> <amount> <asset> <memo> <broadcast>
    
*(Example 1):*
 `faucet` wants to send 100000 `CORE` to `alpha` user.

    unlocked >> transfer faucet alpha 100000 CORE "here is the cash" true

*(Example 2):*
`Alice` wants to send 10 `USD` to `bob`.

    unlocked >> transfer alice bob 10 USD "a gift" true

The wallet will return the actual signed transaction.

***

**Obtain the private key**

The `get_private_key` command allows us to obtain the **private key** corresponding to the block signing key.
(*Get the WIF private key corresponding to a public key. The private key must already be in the wallet.* )

    >>> get_private_key(<pubkey>) 
   

    >>> get_private_key GPH6viEhYCQr8xKP3Vj8wfHh6WfZeJK7H9uhLPDYWLGCRSj5kHQZM

***

**Open a new Wallet for `alpha` user**

    >>> import_key alpha 5HuCDiMeESd86xrRvTbexLjkVg2BEoKrb7BAA5RLgXizkgV3shs

    >>> upgrade_account alpha true

    >>> create_witness alpha "http://www.alpha" true
