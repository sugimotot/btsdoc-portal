# Building on OS X

### Available Versions

#### Boost

- Boost: between 1.57 and 1.63

You can check which version(s) of boost you have by asking brew:

    brew search boost

To install another version of Boost (such as 1.60):

    brew install boost@1.60

#### OpenSSL

- OpenSSL: 1.0.x series

You may have an older version of OpenSSL than is required. If so, have brew get the latest:

    brew upgrade openssl

Compiling with these new versions: We must now tell cmake where these libraries are. Instead of the "cmake ." mentioned above, we use:

    cmake -DBOOST_ROOT=/usr/local/opt/boost@1.60 -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl .

and then proceed with the normal

    make
