|  |Blockchain | The Blockchain serves as a journal of user-signed instructions that become a binding agreement as soon as they are included into a block. After inclusion into a block, the agreements are stored indefinitely by means of a hash-linked-list (the Blockchain). From this ordered sequence of transactions, the “current state” of the database (think: account balances) can be determined by processing all transactions consecutively starting at the very first block. As we will see later, the software will ensure that instructions that are stored in the Blockchain have been successfully authenticated and validated. For validating and processing of operations, a common set of rules define the consequences of particular actions, which are part of the of the blockchain protocol  |

|  |Consensus | Consensus is the process by which a community comes to a universally recognized, unambiguous agreement on a piece of information. In the context of blockchains consensus means agreement about the validity rules for transactions, and the order in which they have been observed by the blockchain. This ultimately results in an agreement about the state of a database that is build deterministically from the those validity rules and the sequence of transactions.
