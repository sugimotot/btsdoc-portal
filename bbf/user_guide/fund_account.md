 ## Two Options to Fund your Account
 
- **Send (Transfer)**: This is for between BitShares account holders to send funds. On the BitShares Blockchain , people never need to deal with *addresses* or *public keys*. BitShares account holders can use their *account names* for communication. 
- **Deposits**: BitShares account holders can use one of our partners to move over existing funds into your BitShares account.

## Send (Transfer)

Currently, there are two forms to send funds. One is **Send** on the top menu. Another one is **Send (legacy)** on the side menu. Both work the same.

## Deposit
 
Currently, there are two forms to deposit funds. One is **Deposit** and another one is **Deposit (Beta)**. Both locate on the side menu. 
 
BitShares has partners to provide Transfer (i.g. Gateway/Bridge) services which you can choose from. Each Transfer service has own instraction and available coins to handle. When you selecte a Transfer Service, please follow the instruction. In the next section, we will show you several examples and patterns to compare the deposit forms.

### Deposit Forms items and descriptions

|---|---|---|
| 1 | Transfer Service | a dropdown list - Select a transfer service |
| 2 | Service Type| A service you use |

| 5 | Address | Your deposit address to transfer funds. |
| 6 | Memo  | Your Memo information to transfer funds. (*Not all coins' transfers use `Memo`*) |
| 7 | BitShares Account Name | This would be your BitShares Account name |

> If you cannot select an Asset on the Deposit(Beta) form, try to login to your wallet first.
