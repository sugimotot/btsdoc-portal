## Light wallet or Web wallet?

Before we create a wallet, let's check what type of wallet you wand to have as your BitShares wallet. Quick check the below chart.

</p>

Did you find out which type of wallet you want to have? 

- If you want to install **Light Wallet** (BitShares UI), download [BitShares UI Releases](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/releases) file and install it to your machine.

- If you want to use **Web Wallet**, go to this link (https://wallet.bitshares.org).

## Create your Account

We assume you selected a wallet type and installed (Light wallet) and opened a "Welcome BitShares". 

**Note:**

In BitShares, you can create own **unique account name**, so, you can remember easily. And you will use the account name to communicate (e.g. Send fund) with other BitShares account users (shareholders) like an email address. 

This is very important. Please create a strong password and **write down** or **save** it to a safe place!! Do not lose it. **ONLY you can open your wallet again. No one can help.**

## Dashboard

Let's check the BitShares wallet Dashboard. You might not have any Portfolio yet. As an example, the below wallet has BTS as an Asset.

## Login

Before we go to farther, let's try to login and check if you have a correct password.

You will find a **Locked Key** icon in the top right corner (if you have not logged in). Click the icon to open a login form.
