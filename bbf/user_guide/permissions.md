#### Permissions Tabs

| | tab |     |
|--|----------|----------|
| 1 | Active Permissions | Active permissions define the accounts that have permission to spend funds for this account. |
| 2 | Owner Permissions | Owner permissions define who has control over the account. Owners may overwrite all keys and change any account settings. |
| 3 | Memo Key | The memo key is where you receive memos, in order to decode the memos you need to control the private key for the public key. <br/> By using a public/private key pair without spending authority, you may give read-only access to your memos to third parties. |
| 4 | Cloud Wallet | If you want to be able to login from anywhere using only your password and account name, you can use this page to add new keys to your permissions. If you also want to remove the original keys, you can do so in the active/owner permissions tabs. <br/> The cloud wallet uses a password in combination with your account name to generate your private keys on the fly. It restricts you to only logging in with one account at a time, in return for ease of use and convenience. |
