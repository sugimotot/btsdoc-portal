## Create Local Wallet Backup
It is recommended to make regular backups of your Local. Please note that in order to recover from a backup you will also need to provide the passphrase (password) because backups are encrypted. Hence, if you either lose your wallet or your passphrase you will be unable to access any of your funds again.

You are the only individual that has access to your account and funds, it is your responsibility to make a secure backup of your registered account.

### Backup Types
There are three types of backups.

| type |    |
|-------|--------------|
| Create local wallet backup | create a Binary File (.bin)  |
| Create brainkey backup | give you long random phrases. You need to write down.  |
| Create favorites backup |  |
