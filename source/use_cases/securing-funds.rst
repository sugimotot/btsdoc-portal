Securing Funds
--------------------

Since BitShares 2.0 offers hierarchical corporate accounts to secure your
account name and your funds. With this, you can build hierarchies of accounts
(so called *authorities*) and a condition that has to be fulfilled in order for
a transaction to become valid.

(under construction)

.. .. note:: This functionality is not yet exposed to an API call!
