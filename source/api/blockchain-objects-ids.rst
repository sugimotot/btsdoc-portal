Blockchain Objects and their Identifiers (IDs)
===============================================================================

In contrast to many other projects, the Graphene technology distinguishes
different kinds of objects, in the protocol and implementation space.

In the protocol space, there are raw objects such as, accounts, assets,
committee members as well as orders, proposals and balances. The implementation
space is used to gain access to higher abstraction layers for instance content
of the current database state (these include, current global blockchain
properties, dynamic asset data, transaction histories as well as account
statistics and budget records).
