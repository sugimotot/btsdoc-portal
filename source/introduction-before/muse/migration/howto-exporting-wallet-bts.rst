BitShares' NOTE Token
************************

.. contents:: Contents

Since the snapshot has taken place already, all you need to do now to get
access to your funds in MUSE is described in the following. Note that the name
of the asset in BitShares 1.0 was **NOTE** instead of **MUSE**.

Firstly, you need to upgrade your BitShares client to version 0.9.3c. To do the
upgrade you need to:

* download the installation file from the `bitshares webpage`_
* uninstall your previous version of the BitShares client
* install the new version

.. _bitshares webpage: http://bitshares.org/download

Attempt to sync with the blockchain (this is only necessary with if you think
that since the last time you did the syncing there have been some new
transactions involving any of your accounts).

You can see the syncing progress from the status bar or from the ``info``
command in the console (``account list->advanced settings->console``).
After having *synced* the blockchain, your wallet will automatically attempt to
rescan the blockchain for new transcations. Depending on the amount of accounts
in your wallet, this steps should only take very few minutes.

Since BitShares 0.9.3c, we have a Graphene compatible Export Keys function that
can be accessed in two ways:

* by accessing it in the main menu
* by issuing a command in the console.

Note that your private keys will be encrypted and you will be required to
provide the corresponding pass phrase when importing your funds into MUSE.

Using the main menu
=======================

Just select ``File Menu -> Export Wallet``  and you'll be asked to select a
file location where the keys will be exported. 

.. note:: Due to a known bug, if you are on Windows the only option that will
        work for you is the console command - the file exported using the menu will not
        be compatible with BTS 2.0. This refers to Windows only.

Using the console
====================

* navigate to the console: Account List -> Advanced Settings -> Console
* type: wallet_export_keys [full path to the file]/[file name].json
  e.g. on Windows: ``wallet_export_keys C:\Users\[your user name]\Desktop\keys.json``
  e.g. on Mac: ``wallet_export_keys /Users/[your user name]/Desktop/keys.json``
  e.g. on Linux: ``wallet_export_keys /home/[your user name]/Desktop/keys.json``
* Please replace ``[your user name]`` with your Windows account name.
* and hit Enter

.. note:: The exported wallet file will be encrypted with your pass phrase!
          Make sure to remember it when trying to use that file again!
.. note:: If you are on Windows and your file path tries to access the C drive
          directly (e.g. C:\keys.json) you might need to run the BitShares client as an
          administrator. So the least complicated option will be to aim for the desktop
          as in the example above.

=======================

The keys of the `web wallet`_ can be exported simply by downloading a backup
wallet. It can be obtained from the web wallet's preferences: 
(`Account List->Advanced Settings->Wallet`).
