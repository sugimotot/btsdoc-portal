Graphene
************

The developers of BitShares formed Cryptonomex to monetize the technology,
experience, reputation and good will they accumulated during their first two
years of development and operations. Much of that technology is embodied in
Grapheneâ„¢, an industrial strength software platform for deploying third
generation cryptographically secure decentralized ledgers known as block chains. 

Graphene based systems have orders of magnitude better performance than
first-generation Bitcoin-derived systems or even the second generation "Bitcoin
2.0" systems that constitute our current closest competitors. Graphene based
systems go beyond mere "checkbook" style payments to offer a broad range of
financial services distinguished by their transparency and inherent
incorruptibility.

BitShares 
************

BitShares is a technology supported by next generation entrepreneurs, investors, and developers with a common interest in finding free market solutions by leveraging the power of globally decentralized consensus and decision making. Consensus technology has the power to do for economics what the internet did for information. It can harness the combined power of all humanity to coordinate the discovery and aggregation of real-time knowledge, previously unobtainable. This knowledge can be used to more effectively coordinate the allocation of resources toward their most productive and valuable use.
