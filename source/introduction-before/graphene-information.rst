DPOS Projects
===============

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) is a new method of securing a crypto-currency's network.  DPOS attempts to solve the problems of both Bitcoin's traditional Proof of Work system, and the Proof of Stake system of Peercoin and NXT. DPOS implements a layer of technological democracy to offset the negative effects of centralization. (Read More: :ref:`delegated-proof-of-stake`)
