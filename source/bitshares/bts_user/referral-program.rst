Referral Program
==================

The purpose of the referral program is to incentivize people to bring in
more people. It compares to a Multi-Level-Marketing (MLM) scheme with
the difference of having only **1 level** where referred individuals can
opt-out by upgrading their account to a :ref:`Life-Time Member (LTM)
<account-memberships>`. Every life time member, can get a cut of the
fees based on child accounts linked to ours via referral.

BitShares has several different kinds of accounts: 

* Basic Account, and
* Lifetime Member.


BitShares Accounts
--------------------

Basic Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Basic Accounts** are free, but do not qualify for the referral
program, nor any cash back on transaction fees.


Lifetime Members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Lifetime Members** pay an upgrade fee and earn **80% cash back on
every fee they pay**. They also qualify for **80% of the fees paid by
Basic Accounts they refer** to the network. These 80% can be split among
the registrar, that actually registers the accounts, and an affiliate
referrer, that brought in the new user.

.. note:: In Q1/2016, the *anual membership* has been removed from the
          code base and no longer exists. References to this kind of
          memberships can be safely ignored.

The referral fees are controlled by the blockchain and are distributed like this:

* 20% go to the network
* 80% go to the referral program

  * of this 80%, x% go to the registrar
  * of this 80%, 100%-x% go to the affiliate referrer

.. note:: For many cases it may make sense to upgrade the account even
          though you don't want to participate in marketing at all
          simply for the reasons to get a cashback of 80% of the fees
          you pay for your own transactions!

What to do?
-----------------

If you want to participate in the referral program, you need to have a
life-time member account, first! Then you can bring in new users by

* running your own faucet and actually register new accounts (will give you
  80% of all the fees of those minus a fraction that you decide to give
  to affiliates (the referrers)
* referring people to a hosted wallet that offers you a cut of the fees
  as an affiliate.

  In this case, most hosted wallets add your account as affiliate if you
  provide the following link structure to people

  ::

      https://<url>/?r=<your-account>

  with ``<your-account>`` being the name of your BitShares Lite-Time
  Member account.

  .. note:: If you want link to pages with in the wallet, e.g. a
            particular decentralized market, you need to have the
            ``?r=`` parameter **before** the ``#``, e.g.::

              https://<url>/?r=<your-account>#/market/USD_BTC

Examples
--------------

When an Basic Account pays $100 to become a Lifetime Member, $50 is paid
to their Referrer, $30 is paid to the nearest Lifetime Member, and $20
is paid to the Network. After this point the Lifetime Member becomes its
own referrer and nearest Lifetime Member and its prior Referrers no
longer get any revenue from this user.
