Create Account - New user
----------------------------

You create a **Cloud wallet**. And *Cloud Wallet Login* will be your default Login Mode.

In order to use BitShares, you will need to register an account. Your *account name* needs to be **unique**, as it will be registered publicly on the blockchain and will be **your identifer** for any transactions you make. 

This comes with many advantages: Besides improved scalability, we have separated the identity from the transaction authorizing signature. In practice, owning an account name is independent from being able to spend its funds. Furthermore, both rights (we call them *permissions*) can split among an arbitrary complex relation of people (we call them *authorities*) using weights and a required thresholds.

**STORE or WRITE DOWN YOUR PASSWORD!!! Keep it in a safe place.**

|		

1. Account Name (PUBLIC)
2. Generated Password - The generated password was created by your browser, locally. No one but you has access to it. Paste it the value and save a copy in a safe place.
3. (Blue squire - Click to copy the password to your clipboard) 
4. Confirm Password
5. After you read each statement, check the **Three check boxes**. - Save your password!! 
6. Click **Create Account**

|

During the process, you will find your account name and identicon.

In contrast to any other platform you have ever used: **Creating an
account at one of our partners will make your account available at ALL
the other partners as well.** Hence, your account name can be seen
similar to a mail address in such that it is **unique** and every
participant in the BitShares network can interact with you independent
of the actual partner providing the wallet.

We also provide a guide on how to **manually** register an account using the :ref:`CLI wallet <cli-wallet>`.
