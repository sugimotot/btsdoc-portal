Legacy BitShares 0.9.3 Blockchain Download
-------------------------------------------

One crucial step in teh migration still takes quite some time and is
technically invovled for those that do **not** see their funds in
BitShares 0.9.3: The need to download the blockchain from the legacy
network. Since only a few nodes still serve the raw blockchain data, we
here provide the full blockchain to download:

:download:`Blockchain Torrent <BitShares-0.9.3-full-blockchain.torrent>`

Usage
^^^^^^^

1. Download the Torrent and use it to obtain a full copy of the `chain/` folder
2. Move this chain folder into your BitShares shared directory:

   * Windows: `%APPDATA%/BitShares`
   * Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/BitShares`
   * Linux: `~/.BitShares`

3. Start BitShares 0.9.3 (not older) and let it re-index the database (be patient)
4. Provide your Passphrase
5. Goto `account list->advanced settings->console` and run `rescan`. Depending on the amount of accounts in your wallet, this steps should only take very few minutes. You can see the syncing progress from the status bar or from the info command in the console.
6. After completion, you should now see your funds again and can continue with exporting your wallet for BitShares 2

Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
