This is a light wallet that connects to a BitShares API provided by the witness_node executable.

It stores all keys locally in the browser, never exposing your keys to anyone as it signs transactions locally before transmitting them to the API server which then broadcasts them to the blockchain network. The wallet is encrypted with a password of your choosing and encrypted in a browser database.
