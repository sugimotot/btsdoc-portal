Proposal & Ideas
==========================


BitShares Improvement Proposal
------------------------------------

BSIP stands for BitShares Improvement Proposal but can also seen as an
improvement *protocol*. A BSIP is a design document providing information to the
BitShares community, or describing a new feature for BitShares or its processes
or environment. The BSIP should provide a concise technical specification of the
feature or the idea and a rationale for it. It may not only describe technical
improvements but also document *best-practises* and recommendations.

We intend BSIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for
collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions
that have gone into BitShares. The BSIP author is responsible for building
consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the BSIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their
revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

A detailed description of the structure of BSIPs can be found in `BSIP-0001`_

Funding Your Ideas
---------------------------------

You have a great idea for a business on top of within the BitShares platform
and are searching for a way to fund your idea? Here are the options we can offer
you:

* **Basic Worker Proposal**:
  All BitShares shareholders can cast a vote for your proposal/idea and will
  decide if they want this feature or not at the price you are asking. If they
  accept the price you asked, you will be #paidbyprotocol in BTS. If not, you
  can of course refine your proposal and try again incorporating feedback
  received from shareholders and the community.
* **Fee Backed Asset**:
  If you produce a feature for BitShares that offers a new service, you can have
  a :doc:`../user/fba` created for your feature and profit from future revenue
  streams generated by that particular feature.
* **Crowdfunding**:
  Instead of profiting from your FBA, you can sell them to investors to fund
  the implementation. Or you simply create, issue and sell a :doc:`../user/uia`.
* **Mixed Funding**:
  You sell some of the FBA and keep the rest for yourself. Maybe the best
  option, you get money instantly to fund the development and you will get more
  later when people use the feature.

**Remarks:**:

If you want to develop a blockchain/backend feature, you *should* probably
cooperate with Cryptonomex as they can consult you how to implement everything
on the blockchain and most shareholders will ask them to check the quality of
your code prior to its hard fork, anyway.

Other tasks, such as basic GUI development, etc. can mostly be dealt with
independently, unless access to the main repository is required. This can be
asked from Cryptonomex or other active, but independent, web developers.
