General - Network and Wallet Configuration
-------------------------------------------

We will work with the following IPs and open the corresponding RPC
ports:

* Trusted Full Node:
   * extern: internet access **required**
   * intern: ``192.168.0.100``
   * port: ``8090``

* Wallet:
   * extern: **no** internet access required
   * intern: ``192.168.0.102``
   * port: ``8092``

Let's go into more detail how to set these up.

Trusted Full Node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the trusted full node, the default settings can be used. For later, we
will need to open the RPC port and listen to an IP address to connect the
wallet to.

.. code-block:: sh

    ./programs/witness_node/witness_node --rpc-endpoint="192.168.0.100:8090"

.. note:: A *witness* node is identical to a full node if no authorized
          block-signing private key is provided.

Wallet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We open up a RPC-JSON-HTTP port to be able to interface with API
requests. The wallet can be connected to the trusted node and listens
for RPC requests on port ``8092`` with:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet --server-rpc-endpoint="ws://192.168.0.100:8090" \
                                     --rpc-http-endpoint="192.168.0.102:8092"

.. note:: For security reasons, the wallet should only listen to localhost or
          the local network and should **NEVER** be exposed to the internet.

For customer withdrawals, we will interface to the wallet's API using
`192.168.0.102:8092`.
