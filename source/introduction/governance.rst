Governance
================

On the BitShares Blockchain, decisions are made by the holders of BTS core native token weighted by the amount of BTS owned. In order to improve voting participation and simplify the life of BTS holders, voters can either vote directly or delegate voting power to so called​proxies. This is similar to a representative democracy, where elected leaders decide the course of action. Those leaders have to account for their actions and can be unelected by the core token holders. Unwanted actions includes censoring, favoring, or simply failure to produce blocks in a timely manner. However, the difference to a democracy is that voters in the community have their vote weighted by the amount of BTS that they own in their account. 
 
At any time, voters have to decide on the following aspects of the BitShares Blockchain: 

Members for Block Production (Witnesses) 
----------------------------------------
Block production in BitShares is arranged through DPoS which requires block producers to run for witness and campaign for sufficient votes from BTS holders before they can produce blocks on the blockchain and consequently get paid per produced block. Given the governance system and quick re-tallying of votes, a misbehaving block producer can be fired within hours. Next to the actual selection of block producers, the voters also have a say over how many block producers should exist. 


Members for Blockchain Governance (Committee) 
---------------------------------------------
The Committee comprises a board that has control over a few blockchain parameters such as block size, block time, witness pay, and over 30 others. Additionally, the committee can change the fee schedule which defines the minimum fee for each operation offered by the system. Voters can cast a vote for how many members the committee should constitute as well as vote for a particular set of members.

Project Funding (Workers) 
-------------------------
Last but not least, the voters have control over who receives funding from the Working Budget of the Blockchain. A worker applies for project funding and needs to campaign for sufficient votes before being paid. Similar to block producers and committee members, the rigorous voting system allows fast removal by BTS holders and proxies.

Initial Allocation 
=====================
The way that BitShares, as it exists today, came into existence is well documented in the archives of bitsharestalk.org. The BitShares Blockchain was created on 13th of October 2015 by the community and block producers of BitShares 0.9 who decided to start a new coin with a distribution identical to where 0.9 had evolved. It was based on code developed with private resources and given to the world for anyone to use under the MIT license. The previous BitShares 0.9 Blockchain was abandoned by the community who had the option to continue that chain but declined to do so. 

In the genesis block of the BitShares Blockchain a total of 2,412,042,197.37963 BTS have been distributed to individual keys accordingly. These BTS can still be claimed by proving ownership of the corresponding private key. 

The BTS token comes with a limited supply that is different from circulating (liquid) supply. A max supply of 3,600,570,502.10207 BTS has been put in place on the blockchain. The difference of initial roughly 1.1B was set aside for future project funding and paying block producers, and is only accessible with approval by the BTS holders through the worker system. This so called working budget is also often referred to​reserves. It is worth noting that revenues made from transactions fees are not shared with holders of BTS but instead go back into the working budget to further fund future development. 


Supply
----------
In this section, we would like to discuss the actual supply of the core BTS token in more detail. Firstly, we define the max supply as that supply that can at most be in circulation, similar to how there will only ever be ​up to 21 million BTC on the Bitcoin Blockchain. Furthermore, the circulating supply represents that amount that currently is in circulation and held by participants on the Blockchain. Obviously, the circulating supply will always be smaller than or equal to the max supply. Furthermore, for voting, only the ​circulating supply applies.

Working Budget
-----------------
The difference between max supply and circulating supply is called the ​Working Budget and is also referred to as ​the reserves. The BitShares Blockchain has a daily budget that can be spent. This budget has a hard-coded upper limit of 
Total funds in the ​working budget / 2924 
From this daily budget, block production as well as for project funding are paid. Of course, the BTS holders have the choice and need to approve funds leaving the working budget.

Block Production (Witnesses) 
------------------------------
Block production comes at a cost for running and maintaining equipment. The BitShares Blockchain acknowledges this fact by paying block producers in core BTS tokens per produced block. Depending on the valuation of BTS, the committee can modify the amount of BTS paid per block. As of Q1/2018, each block is paid with 1 BTS. Those funds are taken from the working budget. 

Project Funding (Workers) 
--------------------------
A certain amount of the daily budget can be allocated to project funding by means of workers. Anyone can set up a worker on the BitShares Blockchain and ask for a daily budget in BTS. If the BTS holders approve a particular worker, the BTS are paid from the daily budget. A Soft-limit defines the maximum amount of the daily budget that is paid to all approved workers. Consequently, those workers that have received more votes from BTS holders will receive their funds first. This means that workers, even if approved, may not be funded if the aforementioned threshold is hit. Furthermore, workers constantly stand under the scrutiny of the BTS holders who can disapprove (e.g. ​fire) workers that do not deliver. 

Transaction Fees & Fee Schedule 
--------------------------------
Additional to block production and project funding which can drain funds from the working budget, there are transaction fees paid by users of the BitShares Blockchain that go back into the working budget. As a consequence, the total amount of BTS in the working budget as well as the total in- and out-flow highly varies over time. However, if compared to most proof-of-work-based Blockchains that constantly pay out a (more or less) fixed amount of tokens to miners, the BitShares Blockchain has a chance to have the working budget grow and consequently the circulating supply shrink. This is the case if the total transactions fees outweigh the funds used for block production and project funding. While, the BTS holders have choices to either increase or decrease the funds used for block production and project funding, the committee has the choice to adapt the transaction fees by means of updating the fee schedule. In contrast to other Blockchains, the BitShares Blockchain comes with fixed fees instead of a fee market . The schedule defines which feature of the 3 Blockchain requires the user to pay which amount of transaction fee for using it. 

Legality of the BTS token 
-----------------------------
It is worth noting that the BitShares Blockchain is not represented by any legal entity and that the core token BTS does not imply ownership rights. The core token merely serves as a utility for governance, paying transaction fees and operating other features that are solely implemented on the BitShares Blockchain.
