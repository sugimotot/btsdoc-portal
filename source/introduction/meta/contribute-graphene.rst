Contribute to Graphene
=======================

Backend Development
-----------------------------

The *Graphene* toolkit has been released under MIT license and is thus
open for anyone to contribute and improve.

Due to the decentralized nature of development in combination with the
powerful source repository system *git*, anyone is free to contribute to
any graphene-based repository.

Since `Cryptonomex`_ is currently the main contributer, we recommend to
fork off of `their repository hosted at github`_.

.. _Cryptonomex: http://cryptonomex.com
.. _their repository hosted at github: https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene

Frontend Development
------------------------------

A corresponding reference frontend implementation is licensed under an
Open Source license as well and contributions are welcome.
The reference implementation developed by Cryptonomex is available at
`github <https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene-ui>`_.
